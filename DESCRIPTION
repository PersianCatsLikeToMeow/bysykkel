Title: Get City Bike Data from Norway
Description: Functions to get, read, and download open bike data from 
    the website and API service of each City Bike provider in Norway. These
    functions assist the R user to read bike data to R, and download bike 
    data to disk, such that the user can focus on data analysis without having
    to leave R. The data is retrieved from the "open data" pages of Oslo City 
    Bike, Oslo Winter Bike, Bergen City Bike, and Trondheim City Bike. The 
    data is made available under the 
    NLOD 2.0 <https://data.norge.no/nlod/en/2.0>.
