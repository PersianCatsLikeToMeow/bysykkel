Title: Get City Bike Data from Norway
Description: Functions to get and download city bike data from 
    the website and API service of each city bike service in Norway. These
    functions minimize time spent on getting Norwegian city bike data, and
    lower barriers to start analyzing the data. The data is retrieved from
    Oslo City Bike, Oslo Winter Bike, Bergen City Bike, and Trondheim City 
    Bike. The data is made available under 
    NLOD 2.0 <https://data.norge.no/nlod/en/2.0>.
